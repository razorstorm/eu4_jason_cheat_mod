 get_support_from_natives_decision_desc: "One of our colonies has very few settlers. We should ensure that more people settle down in that province. \nWe could:\n   - try to \"convince\" some natives to move there.\n\n   - bribe the natives, so that they would ignore our\n     settlers, which would make the colony safer and\n     attrackt more settlers.\n\n   - sent farmers to the colony to reach a higher\n     population fast and save.\n     (That's only possible, if your capital has enough base\n     manpower and if the colony has §Rless§! than §Y800 settlers§!.)\n\n   - sent prisoners from our capital to the colony\n     for reaching a fast but unsave rise of population. \n\nThis decision only allows the increase of population for colonies that have §Gmore than 100§! and §Rless than 900§! settlers, whose natives have §Gless than 7§! aggressiveness and that have §Gat least 100§! natives!"
