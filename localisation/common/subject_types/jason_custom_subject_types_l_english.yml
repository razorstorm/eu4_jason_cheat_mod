These are typically large metropolises that have comparable power, population, and wealth as that of an entire subject nation. Comparable to free cities in the Holy Roman Empire, these cities are often granted a certain degree of autonomy and privileges. They are often used as a means to control over highly productive urban cities that require a certain degree of decentralization for various reasons. Metropolises that reside in core regions are typically directly annexed into the empire, whereas important cities far away from the capital can often be granted the status of an imperial city."
